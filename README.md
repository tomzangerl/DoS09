# Continuous Integration

in short continuous integration is a development practice that aims at detecting errors quickly.

this is done by using a CVS system to which every developer commits daily. 
then builds are made from that repository in an automated fashion.
the goal of this procedure is to find errors quicker by constantly integrating smaller parts into the builds.

requirements
-a cvs
- automated builds
-automated tests (like Junitautomated unit testing framework)
- fast builds
-a building schedule
-a notification system

CI sounds great but it seems alot of effort to set up and might not be viable for very small teams (or students)
